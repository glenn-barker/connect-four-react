# Learning experience

This is my first React project and basically my "hello world". The initial project was was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and the overall idea & implementation is adapted from [React's Tic-Tac-Toe tutorial](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe).
